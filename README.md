## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and password reset with session state management.
- **User Configuration**: Save and load user-specific analysis parameters, observatory settings, and API keys.
- **Pre-processing Options**: Toggle "Astrometry++" (stdpipe refinement) and "Remove Cosmic Rays" (L.A.Cosmic algorithm) before analysis.
- **Interactive Analysis**: All parameters (seeing, detection threshold, border mask, filter band/mag range, etc.) are adjustable via sidebar widgets.
- **Catalog Cross-matching**: Automatic cross-match with Gaia DR3, SIMBAD, SkyBoT, AAVSO VSX, and Milliquas catalogs. Astro-Colibri API integration for transient events.
- **Results Download**: All output files for a session can be downloaded as a ZIP archive. Detailed logs are generated for each analysis.
- **Session State**: All parameters and results are managed via Streamlit session state for persistence and reproducibility.
- **FWHM Distribution Plot**: Automatically generates and saves a histogram of star FWHM values (`[filename]_fwhm.png`) for quality assessment of image seeing and focus.
- **Interactive Visualization**: View results in embedded Aladin Lite viewer and ESA Sky integration.
- **Magnitude Distribution**: Visualize magnitude distributions with automatic histogram creation for both aperture and PSF photometry.


## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later
- Key dependencies:
  - astropy
  - photutils
  - astroquery
  - astroscrappy
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - streamlit
  - stdpipe
  - Flask (for backend)
  - SIRIL 1.2.6 ou + (for plate solving)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pierfra-rocci/rpp.git
   cd rpp
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Using venv (built into Python)
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the backend server (use `backend_prod.py` for production):
   ```bash
   # For development with auto-reload
   python backend.py
   # For production
   # python backend_prod.py 
   ```

5. In a new terminal, start the frontend Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run frontend.py
   ```

   This will redirect you to the login page. Register or log in to access the main app.

## Usage

1. **Login/Register**
   - On first use, click the "Register" button and create an account with username, password, and email.
   - For returning users, enter your credentials and click "Login".
   - If you forget your password, use the "Recover Password" section to reset it via email.

2. **Upload your FITS files**
   - Click "Browse files" in the sidebar to upload your science FITS image.
   - The app supports various FITS formats including compressed files (.fits.gz).

3. **Configure parameters**
   - **Pre-processing Options**: Enable/disable "Astrometry+" and "Remove Cosmic Rays" as needed.
   - **Observatory Location**: Set your observatory's name, latitude, longitude, and elevation.
   - **Analysis Parameters**: Adjust seeing estimate, detection threshold, and border mask size.
   - **Photometry Parameters**: Select the filter band and maximum magnitude limit.
   - **API Keys**: Enter your Astro-Colibri UID key for transient event queries.

4. **Run the analysis pipeline**
   - Click "Photometric Calibration" to process the uploaded image.
   - The app will perform source detection, background estimation, photometry, and catalog cross-matching.
   - View interactive plots including the image visualization, FWHM distribution, and zero-point calibration.
   - Explore matched objects in the Aladin Lite viewer and via ESA Sky.
   - Examine magnitude distribution histograms comparing aperture and PSF photometry results.
   - **New:** Inspect the FWHM distribution plot to evaluate image quality and star sharpness.

5. **Export and analyze results**
   - Download all results as a single ZIP archive using the "Download All Results" button.
   - Save your configuration for future sessions using the "Save" button in the sidebar.
   - All files are saved in the `<user>_rpp_results` directory for later access.

6. **Logout**
   - Click "Logout" in the sidebar when finished to secure your session.

## Workflow

1. **Start the backend**: `python backend.py` (required for authentication and config saving).
2. **Start the frontend**: `streamlit run frontend.py` (always redirects to login page).
3. **Authenticate**: Register or log in. User/session parameters are loaded from the backend if available.
4. **Upload and analyze**: Upload your science FITS file (and optional calibration frames), set parameters, and run the photometry pipeline.
5. **Results**: All outputs (catalogs, plots, logs, config) are saved in `rpp_results` and can be downloaded as a ZIP archive. Cross-matching with Gaia, SIMBAD, SkyBoT, AAVSO VSX, Milliquas, and Astro-Colibri is supported.
6. **Save configuration**: Save your analysis parameters and observatory info to the backend and as a JSON file for reproducibility.

## Authentication & Backend

- User authentication: login, registration, and password recovery are handled via the Streamlit frontend, with user data stored in `users.db` (SQLite).
- User-specific configuration: analysis parameters, observatory info, and catalog settings are saved and restored per user.
- The frontend is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), providing interactive widgets for all analysis parameters, observatory location, and catalog settings.
- The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTPS (default: `https://localhost:5000`).
- Utility scripts: `tools.py` (misc helpers).

## Documentation

Documentation is available in the `doc/` directory:

- [Installation Guide](doc/installation.rst)
- [User Guide](doc/user_guide.rst)

To build the documentation:
```bash
cd doc
make html
```

Then open `doc/_build/html/index.html` in your browser.

## Example Output

The application generates several output files in the `<user>_rpp_results` directory:

- `[filename]_phot.csv` - Photometry catalog with calibrated magnitudes
- `[filename]_header.txt` - FITS header information
- `[filename].log` - Processing log with parameter details and analysis steps
- `[filename]_image.png` - Preview image of the science image
- `[filename]_psf.fits` - PSF model file
- `[filename]_wcs_header.txt` - WCS solution from plate solving
- `[filename]_zero_point_plot.png` - Visualization of zero-point calibration
- `[filename]_results.zip` - Downloadable archive of all output files for the session
- `[filename]_bkg.fits` - Background model FITS file
- `[filename]_histogram_mag.png` - Magnitude distribution histogram comparing aperture and PSF photometry
- `[filename]_fwhm.png` - FWHM distribution histogram for image quality assessment

## Key Updates

- The minimum magnitude parameter has been removed. Now only a maximum magnitude ("Max Calibration Mag") is used for source filtering in the photometric calibration workflow.
- A magnitude distribution histogram is provided comparing aperture and PSF photometry results.
- The output includes a FWHM distribution histogram for image quality assessment.
- All results for a session can be downloaded as a single ZIP archive from the interface.
- Interactive Aladin Lite viewer is embedded for examining identified sources.
- ESA Sky integration for additional sky visualization options.
- The workflow and sidebar options have been streamlined for clarity and ease of use.
